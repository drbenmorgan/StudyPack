StudyPack
=========

A simple project to study packaging with CMake/CPack.

Topics to be looked at:

* Customized STGZ template to allow pre/post install operations.
* Checking required packages (STGZ and PackageMaker).
* Download of components (e.g. large data files).
* Use of BundleUtilities.
* Uninstallers.

The StudyPack application is just a simple C++ "Hello World" for now.
We'll add more complexity (use of system/third-party libraries, GUI) later.
